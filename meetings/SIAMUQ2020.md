<h1>Probabilistic Numerics @ SIAM Conference on Uncertainty Quantification</h1>
<h2>Technical University Munich, Germany, 24 - 27 March 2020</h2>

Four minisymposia on topics relating to *probabilistic numerics* where scheduled at the [SIAM Conference on Uncertainty Quantification 2020](https://siam-uq20.ma.tum.de/), scheduled to be held in Garching near Munich in Southern Germany from 24 to 27 March 2020. Unfortunately, the conference had to be canceled due to the outbreak of COVID-19.
Nevertheless, many speakers provided a recording of their presentation. *Huge thanks to all contributors, despite the tough circumstances!*
