  abstract =	 {This paper proposes a probabilistic framework for algorithms
that iteratively solve unconstrained linear problems Bx = b with positive
definite B for x. The goal is to replace the point estimates returned by
existing methods with a Gaussian posterior belief over the elements of the
inverse of B, which can be used to estimate errors. Recent probabilistic
interpretations of the secant family of quasi-Newton optimization algorithms
are extended. Combined with properties of the conjugate gradient algorithm,
this leads to uncertainty-calibrated methods with very limited cost overhead
over conjugate gradients, a self-contained novel interpretation of the
quasi-Newton and conjugate gradient algorithms, and a foundation for new
nonlinear optimization methods.},
