  year   = {1896},
  notes  = {Likely the first text explicitly discussing the notion of computation as inference. The introduction (§1.7) contains the following insightful, albeit informal, sentence:

  Une question de probabilités ne se pose que par suite de notre ignorance: il n’y aurait place que pour la certitude si nous connaissions toutes les données du problème. D’autre part, notre ignorance ne doit pas être complète, sans quoi nous ne pourrions rien évaluer. Une classification s’opérerait donc suivant le plus ou moins de profondeur de notre ignorance.

  Ainsi la probabilité pour que la sixième décimale d’un nombre dans une table de logarithmes soit égale à 6 est a priori de 1/10; en réalité, toutes les données du problème sont bien déterminées, et, si nous voulions nous en donner la peine, nous connaîtrions exactement cette probabilité. De même, dans les interpolations, dans le calcul des intégrales définies par la méthode de Cotes ou celle de Gauss, etc.

  Further along, in chapter XV, page 292, he constructs a (basic) version of the Wiener integral from scratch and applies it to interpolation problems (in the beginning of that chapter he reviews the problem of interpolating an unknown function over a known basis of polynomials using classical deterministic methods, in the second part he assumes that the coefficients in the basis are Gaussian and treats interpolation points as data in an inference problem).

The paper does not explicitly make the connection to the use of splines in numerics -- which means that many classic numerical methods in various areas can be interpreted as average-case Gaussian inference rules -- but later authors, most notably Diaconis, make it clear that they got the idea.}

  abstract = {The numerical analyst is often called upon to estimate a function from a very limited knowledge of its properties (e.g. a finite number of ordinate values). This problem may be made well posed in a variety of ways, but an attractive approach is to regard the required function as a member of a linear space on which a probability measure is constructed, and then use established techniques of probability theory and statistics in order to infer properties of the function from the given information. This formulation agrees with established theory, for the problem of optimal linear approximation (using a Gaussian probability distribution), and also permits the estimation of nonlinear functionals, as well as extension to the case of "noisy" data.}

  abstract = {We deliver a call to arms for probabilistic numerical methods: algorithms for
numerical tasks, including linear algebra, integration, optimization and
solving differential equations, that return uncertainties in their
calculations. Such uncertainties, arising from the loss of precision induced by
numerical calculation with limited time or hardware, are important for much
contemporary science and industry. Within applications such as climate science
and astrophysics, the need to make decisions on the basis of computations with
large and complex data has led to a renewed focus on the management of
numerical uncertainty. We describe how several seminal classic numerical
methods can be interpreted naturally as probabilistic inference. We then show
that the probabilistic view suggests new algorithms that can flexibly be
adapted to suit application specifics, while delivering improved empirical
performance. We provide concrete illustrations of the benefits of probabilistic
numeric algorithms on real scientific problems from astrometry and astronomical
imaging, while highlighting open problems with these new algorithms. Finally,
we describe how probabilistic numerical methods provide a coherent framework
for identifying the uncertainty in calculations performed with a combination of
numerical algorithms (e.g. both numerical optimisers and differential equation
solvers), potentially allowing the diagnosis (and control) of error sources in
computations.},

  pages = {1--35},
  abstract = {The past century has seen a steady increase in the need of estimating and predicting complex systems and making (possibly critical) decisions with limited information. Although computers have made possible the numerical evaluation of sophisticated statistical models, these models are still designed by humans because there is currently no known recipe or algorithm for dividing the design of a statistical model into a sequence of arithmetic operations. Indeed enabling computers to think as humans, especially when faced with uncertainty, is challenging in several major ways: (1) Finding optimal statistical models remains to be formulated as a well-posed problem when information on the system of interest is incomplete and comes in the form of a complex combination of sample data, partial knowledge of constitutive relations and a limited description of the distribution of input random variables. (2) The space of admissible scenarios along with the space of relevant information, assumptions, and/or beliefs, tends to be infinite dimensional, whereas calculus on a computer is necessarily discrete and finite. With this purpose, this paper explores the foundations of a rigorous framework for the scientific computation of optimal statistical estimators/models and reviews their connections with decision theory, machine learning, Bayesian inference, stochastic optimization, robust optimization, optimal uncertainty quantification, and information-based complexity.},
