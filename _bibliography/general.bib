author = {J. B. Kadane and G. W. Wasilkowski},
abstract = {Relations between average case epsilon-complexity and Bayesian statistics are discussed. An algorithm corresponds to a decision function, and the choice of information to the choice of an experiment. Adaptive information in epsilon-complexity theory corresponds to the concept of sequential experiment. Some results are reported, giving epsilon-complexity and minimax-Bayesian interpretations for factor analysis. Results from epsilon-complexity are used to establish the optimal sequential design is no better than optimal nonsequential design for that problem.},

  publisher = {The Royal Society},

  abstract = {We deliver a call to arms for probabilistic numerical methods: algorithms for
numerical tasks, including linear algebra, integration, optimization and
solving differential equations, that return uncertainties in their
calculations. Such uncertainties, arising from the loss of precision induced by
numerical calculation with limited time or hardware, are important for much
contemporary science and industry. Within applications such as climate science
and astrophysics, the need to make decisions on the basis of computations with
large and complex data has led to a renewed focus on the management of
numerical uncertainty. We describe how several seminal classic numerical
methods can be interpreted naturally as probabilistic inference. We then show
that the probabilistic view suggests new algorithms that can flexibly be
adapted to suit application specifics, while delivering improved empirical
performance. We provide concrete illustrations of the benefits of probabilistic
numeric algorithms on real scientific problems from astrometry and astronomical
imaging, while highlighting open problems with these new algorithms. Finally,
we describe how probabilistic numerical methods provide a coherent framework
for identifying the uncertainty in calculations performed with a combination of
numerical algorithms (e.g. both numerical optimisers and differential equation
solvers), potentially allowing the diagnosis (and control) of error sources in
computations.},
